I'm a Sr. Fullstack Software Engineer with a specific expertise in JavaScript 🟨 & TypeScript 🟦 development, and a love for front-end crafting sublime user-facing experiences.

Passionate about the [Open Web Platform 🕸](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Open_Web_Platform) and [component driven development](https://www.componentdriven.org/) using React ⚛️ and Vue.js 💚.

Experienced in cloud computing 🌩️, using a wide range of tools and technologies such as Go 🐿️, Python🐍, Kubernetes ☸️, Terraform, Pulumi, data pipelines like Kafka 🪳, databases including PostgreSQL 🐘, MongoDB 🍃, MySQL 🐬, and cloud services like Azure 💠 and AWS 🔶. Also proficient in CI/CD deployment processes with GitHub Actions 🐙 and monitoring and error tracking tools like Datadog 🐶 and Sentry 🔒.

Coming from background of creating .NET (+WPF), Java (+FX), and mobile applications, I hold a strong interest in UI/UX, and love creating visually appealing effects 💥. I apply this enthusiasm to HTML & CSS, building upon my past experiences with Flash animation.
