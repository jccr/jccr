## Hello world! 👋
  <img align="right" width="110px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5132652/164617212-b56e7fb9-da7a-4bc3-99a7-06b672ce9fd5.png">

I'm a Sr. Fullstack Software Engineer with a specific expertise in JavaScript 🟨 & TypeScript 🟦 development, passionate about crafting sublime front-end, user-facing experiences.

A strong advocate for the [Open Web Platform 🕸](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Open_Web_Platform) and [component driven development](https://www.componentdriven.org/), I love working with React ⚛️ and Vue.js 💚.

My experience in cloud computing 🌩️ involves using a broad range of tools and technologies such as Go 🐿️, Python🐍, Kubernetes ☸️, Terraform, Pulumi, data pipelines like Kafka 🪳, databases including PostgreSQL 🐘, MongoDB 🍃, MySQL 🐬, and cloud services like Azure 💠 and AWS 🔶. I have proficiency in CI/CD deployment processes with GitHub Actions 🐙, and monitoring and error tracking tools such as Datadog 🐶 and Sentry 🔒.

Building upon a background in creating .NET (+WPF), Java (+FX), and mobile applications, I hold a strong interest in UI/UX and am passionate about creating visually stunning effects 💥. I channel this creativity into HTML & CSS, building on my past experiences with Flash animation.

Recently, I've been delving into the AI/ML world, gaining practical experience applying open-source models from Hugging Face, with PyTorch, and employing TensorFlow.js / TFLite for web/mobile inference.
I've also innovated with prompt engineering and generative models using OpenAI's GPT-4 in a production SaaS application.
