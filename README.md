I'm a passionate software engineer based in Canada 🇨🇦 with 9 years of professional experience. 👨‍💻

My focus for the majority of these years has been in the JavaScript & TypeScript ecosystem.  
In the past two years I have immersed myself in the cloud computing space. 🌩️   
I've been working with Go, Kubernetes, Kafka, PostgreSQL and Azure & AWS.
